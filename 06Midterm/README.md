# Midterm Project
- based on the codealong.js file from last week

## Task 1: Modify detectSound() to categorize sound into three levels: quiet, medium, and loud.
- You will need to adjust the detection function to assess sound amplitude and assign it to one of the three categories: quiet, medium, or loud. Depending on the sound's intensity, you can adjust the volume thresholds for each category.

## Task 2: Add three new keys (e.g., 'L') to load and play three different sound files independently.
- This task requires adding new key bindings to your interactive interface that correspond to different sound files. The user can press the keys (such as 'L') to trigger specific sound files to play.

## Task 3: Enhance speech recognition to respond to a specific phrase (e.g., "play sound").
- You need to implement a speech recognition feature that listens for a given phrase (such as "play sound") and triggers the relevant actions, such as playing a sound or changing an element in the project.

## Task 4: Modify text-to-speech output with three different rates: slow, medium, and fast.
- For this task, you need to implement a text-to-speech system that can vary its speech speed based on user input. You should provide three distinct speech rate options.

## Steps for Completion:
- Prepare the Files: Ensure that all tasks are organized into separate files for each phase of the project.
- Testing: Thoroughly test each of the tasks to ensure that they fulfill the project’s requirements (e.g., that sounds play at the correct levels, the speech recognition works as expected, and the text-to-speech output varies in speed).
- Documentation: Write a clear and concise documentation file explaining your approach to each of the tasks, how you implemented the code, and any challenges or noteworthy insights you encountered during development.
- Submit: Create a folder named “midterm” in your GitHub repository, include all project files as listed below, and push this folder to GitHub. Submit the link to this folder via Canvas:
	- task1.js // File for Task 1: Categorizing sound levels
	- task2.js // File for Task 2: Playing sound files with keys
	- task3.js // File for Task 3: Speech recognition for specific phrase
	- task4.js // File for Task 4: Text-to-speech with adjustable rates
	- README.md // Documentation file

## Grading Considerations:
Make sure each of the tasks is fully implemented and documented.
The documentation should clearly explain your thought process and coding strategies.
Ensure the final presentation in class is clear and demonstrates how the project functions.
