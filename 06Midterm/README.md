# Midterm Project
1. Using the codealong.js file from last week (05.Functions) create an interactive sound project in p5.js that has a least three keys (e.g., 'L') that load and play three different sound files independently.
- This task requires adding new key bindings to your interactive interface that correspond to different sound files. The user can press the keys (such as 'L') to trigger specific sound files to play.
2. Save the project on p5js.org
3. SUBMIT (as outlined in the Syllabus!)
- Your README.md Documentation file (as outlined in the Syllabus!) which INCLUDES A HYPERLINK TO YOUR PROJECT ON P5js.org
4. Save all documentation file changes and push them using GitHubDesktop up to GitHub.com. Take the link to the "midtermproject" subfolder in your itp repo and put it in the 'midtermproject' Assignment in Canvas.

## Grading Considerations:
Make sure each of the tasks is fully implemented and documented.
The documentation should clearly explain your thought process and coding strategies.
Ensure the final presentation in class is clear and demonstrates how the project functions.
