# Hello, World

## What is Computer Programming?
- We're telling the computer what to do step-by-step
- Just like a "program" tells the audience the order of pieces/movements in a concert

## Computers are dumb; you are smart
- But! They can remember a lot and they're patient

## [Binary Numbers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Binary_number)
- We humans are used to Base 10 counting (because of our fingers and toes? maybe. But don't forget 0!)
- Base 2 Counting
- "Ship name": binary digits = bits

## Boolean Logic
- Yes or No
- True or False
- Is there a charge in the capacitor (battery) or no
- 1 or 0

## Context is everything
- Context is called the "environment" in programming
- Information that you can take for granted in the environment is "abstracted-out"

## Abstraction
- Lower-level implementation details are hidden below higher-level ideas, can be taken for granted in the environment
- e.g., I'm music metaphors teaching this programming class because this is a music school

## Representing Data in Computers
- Layer upon layer of abstraction

## Algorithms
- Algorithms: chains of instructions for simple operations that come together to accomplish a complex task
	- The user of the algorithm doesn't think about the chains of instructions, only thinks about input and output
![image of black box with an arrow in labelled 'input' and an arrow out labelled 'output'](img/algorithm.png)
- Thinking: breaking the steps of a long operation down into small, explicit substeps and anticipating contingencies
	- Cooking with recipes
-  Efficiency: fewest number of steps to accomplish a complex task

## 20 Questions in Boolean Logic
- Let's guess where someone in this room is from (their "hometown") with only 'Yes' or 'No' questions
- How can we make the game go slower? Faster?

## Introductions
- Name+Pronoun
- Major+Principal Instrument
- Semester@Berklee
- Best thing you ate over break
- What operating system are you on?
- How are you doing on storage?

## Big Picture
- Survey of a few languages (SQL, JavaScript, HTML/CSS, Python)
- Teaching you to problem-solve patiently, precisely, and creatively to inspire LIFE-LONG LEARNING
- We'll use [participatory live coding](https://journals.plos.org/ploscompbiol/article?id=10.1371/journal.pcbi.1008090) / 'chalk and talk' / code along
- *ALL* the materials of the course are provided for you all together, we'll go through them all together step-by-step
- I am not a graphical thinker, sorry
- I am an expert musician, expert educator, competent practitioner programmer  
- I don't know how good you are at coding, but *you* also don't know how good you are at coding
  - [imposter syndrome](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK585058/#:~:text=Introduction,accomplishments%20among%20high%2Dachieving%20individuals.)
  - [dunning-kreuger effect](https://thedecisionlab.com/biases/dunning-kruger-effect)
- I'm going to try and meet you where you're at, but you gotta tell me where you're at
  - Formative assessment
  - Summative assessment
- I'm trying to meet you *all* where you are, leave no learner behind, so please be patient
  - Occasionally will ask you to pair up (risks vs rewards)
  - Minecraft
