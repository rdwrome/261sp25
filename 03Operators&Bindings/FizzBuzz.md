# FizzBuzz DUE NEXT CLASS

1. Create a file named `fizzbuzz.js`.
- Write a JavaScript program that prints all the integers between 1 and 100, except in three situations:

If an integer in the counter is divisible by 3, print "Fizz";

if an integer in the counter is divisible by 5, print "Buzz";

if an integer in the counter is divisible by both 3 and 5, print "FizzBuzz".

The first 5 integers in the console should look like this:
<pre>
					 1
					 2
					 Fizz
					 4
					 Buzz
</pre>

2. SUBMIT (as a link in Canvas to an assignment subfolder in *your* GitHub repository):
	- Your .js file
	- A documentation file (in Markdown as an .md file!) that includes information about all three (3) files as outlined in the syllabus!
