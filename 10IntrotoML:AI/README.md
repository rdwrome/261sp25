# AI & ML

## Singularity & Cyborgs
- [Ray Kurzweil](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/83518.The_Singularity_is_Near)
- [Donna Haraway](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A_Cyborg_Manifesto)

## Uncanny Valley

- Bots
- [Cats (2019)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FtSd844cI7U)
- Robots: OK, Humans: OK. Can't tell? Not OK
- Your ability to tell is **socially-constructed**
- [AIVA](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6I3aKYyKl68)
- The concept of "smart" is **socially-constructed**

## Early 'AI'
- "Science of Making Machines Smart" - Demis Hassabis (Google DeepMind)
- Make a machine do something 'smart,' automatically adapt to users, provide them unique experience
- Early methods include **Logic or Expert Systems**
  - Creator 'solves' problem
  - [DeepBlue](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deep_Blue_(chess_computer))
  - Can't deal with the unexpected, can't learn anything new

## Machine Learning
  - Machine can learn new things
  
#### Types of Machine Learning
  - Supervised (training data has all the answers)
  - Unsupervised (anomaly detection)
  - Semisupervised (partially labelled, looking for patterns)
  - Reinforcement learning (getting towards AI...like training a dog with positive and negative rewards)

#### Modes
  - Batch learning (you get all the training data at once)
  - "Online" learning (system can accept new training data on the go)
  - Instance-based (commits training data to memory, then compares new data to training data)
  - Model-based (generalizes from a set of examples then uses that model to make predictions)

#### Problems...
  - Insufficient quantity of training data
  - Poor quality of training data
  - Non-representative training data
  - Transparent Data Gathering Practices?
  - Transparent Training Practices?
  - Transparent Model Distribution?
  - [Google Translate](https://translate.google.com/)
  - [chatGPT-3](https://www.nytimes.com/2022/04/15/magazine/ai-language.html?searchResultPosition=2)
  - but can it learn **beyond its training data**?

## 'Generative AI' (capitalist branding of Machine Learning)
- automatically adapts to users, provide them unique experiences
- can learn new things
##### Large Language Models 
- chatGPT (openAI...Microsoft), llama (META), Gemini (Google)
##### izotope, logic, others?

### [Artificial General Intelligence](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_general_intelligence)
- 'true AI' according to AI researchers, not yet in public use
- Neural Networks
  - identifies + reproduces patterns in the same way a human brain does (car+broom == vacuum)
  - used to be called "deep learning"
- *what can it learn beyond it's training data?*
