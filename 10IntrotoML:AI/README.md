#### **Singularity & Cyborgs**
- [Ray Kurzweil](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/83518.The_Singularity_is_Near)
- [Donna Haraway](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A_Cyborg_Manifesto)

#### **Uncanny Valley**
- Turing Test
- Bots & your parents
- [Cats (2019)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FtSd844cI7U)
- Robots: OK, Humans: OK. Can't tell? Not OK
- One's ability to tell a robot from a human is **socially-constructed**

- The concept of "smart" is **socially-constructed**

## Silicon Valley/Capitalism vs Academia **ML vs AI** definitions
- Machine Learning: machine can automatically adapt to users, learn new things, and automatically adapt to those new things
- AI is "Science of Making Machines Smart" - Demis Hassabis (Google DeepMind)...

## Early AI: **Logic or Expert Systems**
- Creator 'solves' problem for the machine, provides the solutions to the machine
- [DeepBlue](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deep_Blue_(chess_computer))
- Machine can't deal with the unexpected, can't learn anything new, but does automatically adapt to users

## **Machine Learning**
- Machine can learn new things
  
#### Types of Machine Learning
  - Supervised (training data has all the answers)
  - Unsupervised (anomaly detection)
  - Semisupervised (partially labelled, looking for patterns)
  - Reinforcement learning (getting towards AI...like training a dog with positive and negative rewards)

#### Modes
  - Batch learning (you get all the training data at once)
  - "Online" learning (system can accept new training data on the go)
  - Instance-based (commits training data to memory, then compares new data to training data)
  - Model-based (generalizes from a set of examples then uses that model to make predictions)

#### Problems...
  - Insufficient quantity of training data
  - Poor quality of training data
  - Non-representative training data
  - Transparent Data Gathering Practices?
  - Transparent Training Practices?
  - Transparent Model Distribution?

## **'Generative AI'** (capitalist branding of Machine Learning)
##### Large Language Models 
- chatGPT (openAI...Microsoft), llama (META), Gemini (Google)
##### izotope, logic, others?

## Embodiment

### [Artificial General Intelligence](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_general_intelligence)
- Neural Networks
  - identifies + reproduces patterns in the same way a human brain does (car+broom == vacuum)
  - used to be called "deep learning"
- *what can it learn beyond it's training data?*
