# ChessBoard DUE NEXT CLASS

3.  Create a file named `chessboard.js`.
- Write a .js program that uses console.log to print a chess board grid (width =
height) where the value in a definition of a binding called "size"
changes the width and height of the grid. E.G. size = 8 will print out:

<pre>
 # # # #
# # # #
 # # # #
# # # #
 # # # #
# # # #
 # # # #
# # # # </pre>

4. SUBMIT (as a link in Canvas to an assignment subfolder in *your* GitHub repository):
	- Your three (3) .js files
	- A documentation file (in Markdown as an .md file!) that includes information about all three (3) files as outlined in the syllabus!
