# FizzBuzz

1. Create a file named `FizzBuzz.js`.

2. Write a JavaScript program that prints all the integers between 1 and 100, except in three situations:

If an integer in the counter is divisible by 3, print "Fizz";

if an integer in the counter is divisible by 5, print "Buzz";

if an integer in the counter is divisible by both 3 and 5, print "FizzBuzz".

The first 5 integers in the console should look like this:
<pre>
					 1
					 2
					 Fizz
					 4
					 Buzz
</pre>

3. SUBMIT (as outlined in the Syllabus!)
	- Your .js file
	- Your README.md Documentation file (as outlined in the Syllabus!)

4. Save all changes and push them using GitHubDesktop up to GitHub.com. Take the link to the "FizzBuzz" subfolder in your itp repo and put it in the 'FizzBuzz' Assignment in Canvas.
